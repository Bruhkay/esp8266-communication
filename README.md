# esp8266-communication
This program is designed to demonstrate how an ESP8266 microcontroller can be integrated with the IoT platform ThingSpeak to send and receive data over the internet. The code connects the ESP8266 to a specified WiFi network and utilizes HTTP GET requests to interact with ThingSpeakâ€™s REST API. It allows the device to operate in two modes: as a transmitter, it sends data (e.g., sensor readings) to a specific field in a ThingSpeak channel, and as a receiver, it fetches and processes data from the channel. This functionality can be used for a wide range of IoT applications, such as remote monitoring and control systems, where devices communicate in real-time over the cloud.
